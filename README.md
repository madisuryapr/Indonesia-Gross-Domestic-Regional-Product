# Indonesia Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP)

This repository contains Indonesia Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) Database project, in which comprises quarterly 
data for Indonesia's 38 provinces overall economy performance, encompassing 2010 to 2024 period of time. I engineered Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT)
process to cleanse the data with Power Query and designed its corresponding Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) by utilizing DataGrip.

The cleansed data are deployed within PostgreSQL system as the Data Warehouse. The process of ELT, data cleansing, and deploying will be
examined later.
