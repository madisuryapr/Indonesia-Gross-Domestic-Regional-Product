# Database Preparation
This folder contains the clean dataset and SQL syntaxes for creating and deploying this database. There are three procedures
employed for devising this database as follows:
1. First, I create this database and both fact and dimension tables;
2. Secondly, I import the dataset to each corresponding table; and
3. Finally, I assign both primary and foreign keys to enhance the convenience in analyzing data in the future.
